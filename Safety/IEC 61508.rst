1–2 | Structured programming, defensive coding, modular design        | Structured text, ladder, C (MISRA subset)
3   | Strong typing, static analysis, diverse design, fault injection | Restricted C/C++, formal methods (limited)
4   | Formal methods, diverse programming, full coverage + independence| SPARK Ada, Astrée, Frama-C, very strict subset

🛡️ 7. Quick One-liners (what safety engineers actually say)

- “SIL 3 almost always needs 1oo2D or better – 1oo1 is rarely sufficient.”
- “PFDavg is dominated by proof test interval – test more often or improve diagnostics.”
- “β-factor > 10 % usually kills your SIL 3 architecture.”
- “For SIL 4 you need formal methods or extremely strong proven-in-use data.”
- “Partial stroke testing is the easiest way to get high DC on valves.”
- “Software for SIL 3/4 must be developed completely independently from BPCS.”
- “FMEDA + field failure data is the realistic path for Route 2H.”

This cheat sheet covers the ~80 % of IEC 61508 concepts you will encounter in process, machinery, and safety instrumented system projects in 2026. Keep Part 2 (hardware), Part 3 (software), and the SIL tables close when doing FMEDA or SIL verification.
