**🟢 🟢 DO-178B / 🟢 🟢 DO-178C Cheat Sheet**  
⭐ (Comparison & Key Concepts – valid for avionics software certification in 2025–2026)

🟢 🟢 DO-178B (1992) is now **obsolete** for new projects, but still appears in legacy systems.  
🟢 🟢 DO-178C (2011 + supplements) is the **current standard** required by FAA/EASA for new airborne software.

📌 1. Quick Comparison Table – 🟢 🟢 DO-178B vs 🟢 🟢 DO-178C

Aspect                        | 🟢 🟢 DO-178B (1992)                          | 🟢 🟢 DO-178C (2011 + supplements)                     | Practical Impact (2025–2026)

**A** | Catastrophic (aircraft loss / fatalities) | Primary flight controls, engine FADEC, autopilot servos | Highest – ~71 objectives
**B** | Hazardous / Severe-Major             | Flight management, display systems, TCAS      | High – ~69 objectives
**C** | Major                                | Weather radar, cabin pressurization           | Medium – ~50 objectives

📚 5. Supplements – Quick Reference (🟢 🟢 DO-178C ecosystem)

Supplement | Title / Focus                               | When you must reference it
-----------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------
**🟢 🟢 DO-330** | Software Tool Qualification Considerations  | Every tool used in development/verification
**🟢 🟢 DO-331** | Model-Based Development & Verification      | Simulink/Stateflow, SCADE, SysML
**🟢 🟢 DO-332** | Object-Oriented Technology & Related Techniques | C++, Java (rare in avionics)
**🟢 🟢 DO-333** | Formal Methods Supplement                   | Model checking, theorem proving (e.g. Astrée, Frama-C, Coq)

⚙️ 6. Tool Qualification Levels (🟢 🟢 DO-330 – much easier than 🟢 🟢 DO-178B)

TCL | Criteria                                    | Typical Tools
----|---------------------------------------------|---------------
**TCL-1** | Output directly used as safety artifact     | Code generator that produces Level A code
**TCL-2** | Output affects development/verification     | Static analyzer, test generator, compiler
**TCL-3** | Support tool – no direct impact             | Most configuration management, requirements tools

**TCL-3 is the most common qualification level in 2025–2026.**

⚙️ 7. Quick One-liners (what certification auditors & engineers say)

- “Level A code still needs MC/DC — no way around it.”
- “If you use Simulink, you must follow 🟢 🟢 DO-331.”
- “Compiler is TCL-2 unless you prove it otherwise.”
- “We use Astrée for stack & WCET analysis — helps Level A.”
- “Traceability from high-level requirements to object code is non-negotiable.”
⭐ - “Change impact analysis is critical for incremental certification.”
- “SQA must be independent — no exceptions.”

📌 8. Modern Reality (2025–2026)

- **Most new avionics** → 🟢 🟢 DO-178C + 🟢 🟢 DO-331 (model-based)
- **Formal methods (🟢 🟢 DO-333)** → growing for Level A critical code
- **Agile + 🟢 🟢 DO-178C** → possible with strong planning & tool support
- **Toolchain** → VectorCAST, LDRA, Cantata, QAC, Polyspace, SCADE, Simulink Design Verifier, Astrée
- **Certification time** → 18–36 months typical for Level A/B

🟢 🟢 Good luck with your avionics certification effort!  
The biggest time sinks are usually **MC/DC coverage**, **tool qualification**, **traceability gaps**, and **change impact analysis** — start early with PSAC and tool selection.
