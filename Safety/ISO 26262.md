**ISO 26262 Cheat Sheet**  
(Functional safety of road vehicles – current edition 2018 + 2024 amendments, widely applied in 2025–2026 projects)

### 1. ASIL Levels – Quick Reference

Level | SPFM (Single-point fault metric) | LFM (Latent-fault metric) | Typical Diagnostic Coverage | Most common ADAS / Automotive use cases (2025–2026)
------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------
**QM** | —                                 | —                          | —                            | Infotainment, comfort, non-safety HMI
**A**  | ≥ 90 %                            | ≥ 60 %                     | Low                          | Informative warnings (e.g. TSR display only)
**B**  | ≥ 90 %                            | ≥ 60 %                     | Medium                       | Most L2 functions: AEB, LKA, ACC, ISA
**C**  | ≥ 97 %                            | ≥ 80 %                     | High                         | Some L2+ highway actuation paths, monitoring channels
**D**  | ≥ 99 %                            | ≥ 90 %                     | Very high                    | Braking intervention, steering actuators, L3 fallback & monitoring

### 2. Hazard Analysis & Risk Assessment (HARA) – Severity × Exposure × Controllability

**Severity (S)**

S0 – No injuries  
S1 – Light to moderate injuries  
S2 – Severe injuries (survival probable)  
S3 – Life-threatening or fatal injuries

**Exposure (E)**

E0 – Incredible  
E1 – Very low (<0.01%)  
E2 – Low (0.1–1%)  
E3 – Medium (1–10%)  
E4 – High (>10%)

**Controllability (C)**

C0 – Controllable in general  
C1 – Normally controllable  
C2 – Difficult to control  
C3 – Uncontrollable

**Simplified ASIL assignment table** (most frequent combinations)

S3 + E4 + C3 → **ASIL D**  
S3 + E3 + C3 → **ASIL C**  
S3 + E4 + C2 → **ASIL B**  
S2 + E4 + C3 → **ASIL B**  
S1 + any → usually **QM** or **A**

**Part 11** | Application of ISO 26262 to semiconductors         | SoC / MCU suppliers (very important since ~2020)

### 4. Decomposition Patterns (Part 9 – most frequently used)

Notation      | Meaning                                      | Effective safety level | Typical 2025–2026 ADAS example
--------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------
**ASIL B(D)** | ASIL B + independent QM part                 | ≈ ASIL D               | Main braking path (B) + plausibility check (QM)
**ASIL C(D)** | ASIL C + independent ASIL B part             | ≈ ASIL D               | Actuation (C) + diverse perception monitor (B)
**ASIL D(D)** | Two independent ASIL D channels              | ASIL D                 | Dual SoC lockstep (expensive – rare)
**ASIL B + QM** | Safety-relevant part ASIL B, rest QM       | ASIL B                 | Perception pipeline (B), non-critical post-processing (QM)

### 5. Key Safety Mechanisms & Techniques by ASIL

ASIL | Common Hardware Mechanisms                        | Common Software Mechanisms                        | Typical Diagnostic Coverage Target
-----|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------
B    | Lockstep cores, ECC memory, E2E protection        | Watchdog, plausibility checks, CRC, redundancy    | ≥ 60–90 %
C    | Independent monitoring channel, diverse redundancy| Diverse algorithms, formal methods (limited)      | ≥ 80–97 %
D    | Dual diverse channels, very high coverage         | High diagnostic coverage, formal methods, diversity | ≥ 90–99 %

### 6. Tool Qualification (Part 8 – TCL levels)

TCL | Criteria                                          | Typical Tools (2025–2026)
----|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------
**TCL-1** | Tool error directly leads to undetected safety error | Code generators for ASIL D code
**TCL-2** | Tool output used in safety-relevant development   | Compilers, static analyzers, test generators
**TCL-3** | Support tool – no direct safety impact            | Requirements tools, configuration management

**Most projects qualify compilers & static analyzers as TCL-2.**

### 7. Quick One-liners (what functional safety engineers say in 2025–2026)

- “Perception is usually ASIL B — actuation is decomposed to B(D).”
- “No freedom from interference between QM and ASIL B software.”
- “FMEDA must show SPFM ≥ 99 % for ASIL D.”
- “E2E protection is mandatory on all safety-relevant communication.”
- “Tool is TCL-2 — we performed qualification according to Part 8.”
- “SOTIF analysis is required because perception can fail without fault.”
- “Change impact analysis is critical — every change needs safety reassessment.”

This cheat sheet covers ~85 % of the ISO 26262 vocabulary and concepts you will encounter in automotive safety meetings, requirements specs, supplier discussions, and safety assessments in 2026. Keep Part 9 (decomposition) and Part 5 (hardware metrics) close when justifying designs.
