**Right side** = **integration & verification/validation** (testing & proving correctness)  
**Crossing point** = Implementation (code / hardware)

🛡️ 5. Quick One-liners (what safety engineers actually say)

- “Left side defines what must be safe — right side proves it is.”
- “No traceability gap between safety goal → requirement → test → result.”
- “For ASIL D / Level A you need 100% MC/DC — no shortcuts.”
- “Verification must be at least as independent as the ASIL requires.”
- “Model-based? Then 🟢 🟢 DO-331 / MB.2 workflow is mandatory.”
- “Safety case is not a document — it’s the living argument backed by evidence.”
- “Every change requires impact analysis — regression testing is non-negotiable.”

📌 6. Modern Reality (2025–2026)

- Most projects use **hybrid V-Model + agile elements** (sprints within phases)
- **Model-based development** (🟢 🟢 DO-331) is dominant for control algorithms
⭐ - **Traceability automation** (requirements ↔ model ↔ code ↔ tests) is critical
- **Formal methods** are increasingly used for Level A / ASIL D kernels
- **Certification time** for Level A / ASIL D systems: 18–48 months typical

🟢 🟢 Good luck applying the V-Model in your safety-critical project!  
The biggest killers are usually **missing traceability**, **incomplete coverage**, **non-independent verification**, and **poor change impact analysis** — plan these rigorously from the beginning.
