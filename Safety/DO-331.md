**DO-331 Cheat Sheet**  
(Model-Based Development and Verification Supplement to DO-178C – current as of 2026)

DO-331 is the **official supplement** to DO-178C (2011) that provides specific guidance when using **model-based development** (MBD) techniques for airborne software certification.

It is **mandatory** to reference DO-331 whenever model-based approaches replace or supplement traditional textual high-level/low-level requirements and/or design.

### 1. Core Purpose & Scope

- Extends DO-178C for tools and processes using **executable models** (e.g. Simulink, SCADE, SysML, Stateflow)
- Covers model as source of:
  - High-level requirements
  - Low-level requirements
  - Software architecture
  - Source code generation
- Applies to all software levels (A–E), with more objectives for Level A/B

### 2. Key Model-Based Artifacts & Their Roles

Artifact                              | Traditional Equivalent (DO-178C)       | Typical Use in DO-331 Projects
--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------
**Model**                             | High-level requirements + design       | Primary source of truth (Simulink/Stateflow/SCADE)
**Model simulation / execution results** | Requirements-based test cases        | Verification evidence
**Generated code**                    | Source code                            | From qualified code generator
**Model coverage data**               | Structural coverage (MC/DC etc.)       | Model-level instead of code-level (in many cases)
**Data dictionary / model elements**  | Software requirements standards        | Defines semantics, data types, interfaces

### 3. Main Compliance Options (Table MB.1 – most important)

Option | Description                                                                 | When Most Used (2025–2026)
-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------
**MB.1** | Model used for requirements & design → code manually written               | Rare (defeats main benefit)
**MB.2** | Model used for requirements & design → qualified code generator produces code | Most common (Simulink → Embedded Coder)
**MB.3** | Model used for low-level requirements & design → manual/qualified code gen | Common in safety-critical control logic
**MB.4** | Model used only for simulation / prototyping (not certification credit)    | Early prototyping only

**MB.2 is dominant** in civil avionics in 2026 (especially flight controls, engine controls, autopilot).

### 4. Key Objectives Unique or Modified in DO-331 (Table MB.6–MB.9 simplified)

Objective                              | Level A | Level B | Level C | Typical Means of Compliance
--------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|-----------------------------
Model requirements are accurate & consistent | 100%    | 100%    | 100%    | Model review + simulation
Model simulation covers normal & robustness cases | 100%    | 100%    | 100%    | Simulation harness + test vectors
Model structural coverage (decision, MC/DC) | 100%    | 100%    | —       | Model coverage tools (Simulink Coverage, SCADE)
Traceability: model ↔ requirements ↔ tests ↔ code | 100%    | 100%    | 100%    | Traceability matrix / tool (Polarion, DOORS)
Code-to-model traceability (if generated code) | 100%    | —       | —       | Qualified code generator report
Model standards compliance             | 100%    | 100%    | 100%    | Model style guide review

### 5. Tool Qualification in Model-Based Context (DO-330 + DO-331)

Tool Type                          | Typical TCL | Examples (2025–2026)
-----------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------
**Code generator**                 | TCL-1 or TCL-2 | Embedded Coder, SCADE KCG, QGen
**Model verification / coverage tool** | TCL-2     | Simulink Design Verifier, Simulink Coverage, SCADE Suite Verifier
**Simulation engine**              | TCL-2       | Simulink, SCADE Simulator
**Model checker / formal tool**    | TCL-2 / TCL-3 | Simulink Design Verifier (Prover plugin), Astrée for models
**Requirements management / traceability** | TCL-3 | Polarion, IBM DOORS, Jama

**TCL-1 code generators** are rare — most projects accept **TCL-2** with additional reviews.

### 6. Common Model-Based Development Flow (2025–2026 industry practice)

1. **Model creation** → Simulink / SCADE → high-level requirements
2. **Model-in-the-loop (MIL) simulation** → verify functional behavior
3. **Model standards & reviews** → check modeling guidelines
4. **Model coverage analysis** → achieve decision/MC/DC on model
5. **Code generation** → qualified generator (Embedded Coder, KCG)
6. **Software-in-the-loop (SIL)** → verify generated code matches model
7. **Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)** → final integration testing
8. **Traceability & artifact review** → show model → code → test coverage

### 7. Quick One-liners (what auditors & engineers actually say)

- “If you generate code from model, you must follow MB.2.”
- “Model coverage can replace code coverage for Level A/B if generator is qualified.”
- “Simulink Coverage must reach 100% MC/DC on the model for Level A.”
- “We use qualified code generator + model review instead of object-code verification.”
- “Model standards are audited just like coding standards.”
- “MIL + SIL equivalence testing is non-negotiable for MB.2.”
- “DO-331 reduced verification effort compared to manual coding — but traceability is brutal.”

### 8. Modern Reality (2025–2026)

- **~70–80%** of new flight-critical avionics software uses DO-331 + MB.2 workflow
- **Tools ecosystem**: MathWorks (Simulink + Embedded Coder + Verification & Validation), ANSYS SCADE Suite, QGen
- **Biggest pain points**:
  - Achieving 100% model MC/DC coverage
  - Traceability from model elements to high-level requirements
  - Qualifying the code generator (TCL-1 vs TCL-2 debate)
  - Proving model-code behavioral equivalence

Good luck with your model-based certification effort!  
Most teams that adopt DO-331 properly report **30–50% verification cost reduction** compared to traditional textual + manual coding approaches — but only if model standards, traceability, and tool qualification are done rigorously from day one.
