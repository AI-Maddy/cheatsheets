| **Technical Safety Requirement (TSR)** | Allocation to HW/SW                         | “Brake ECU shall detect pedal position within 10 ms”  | FSR → TSR              |
| **Software Safety Requirement** | SW-specific refinement                      | “Brake SW shall set fault flag if sensor timeout > 50 ms” | TSR → SwRS             |
| **Software Requirement (non-safety)** | Functional / performance                   | “Display shall refresh at 60 Hz”                      | SysRS → SwRS           |

⭐ 🛡️ 6. Quick Rules of Thumb (Safety-Critical 2026 Practice)

- **ASIL D / DAL A** → every requirement **must** be verifiable (testable or analyzable)
- **Derived requirements** → must be **explicitly justified** & traced (🟢 🟢 DO-178C Objective A-2.3 / ISO 26262-6)
- **Traceability matrix** → bidirectional & **complete** (parent ↔ child ↔ test)
- **One requirement = one thought** → 🔴 🔴 avoid “shall 🟢 🟢 do A and B” → split
- **Quantify whenever possible** → “fast” → “response time ≤ 50 ms”
- **ALARP argument** → only allowed when safety target already met (ISO 26262)
- **Change impact analysis** → mandatory for every change in ASIL B+ (ASPICE SUP.8)

This cheatsheet reflects current 🟢 🟢 best practices in requirements engineering for embedded & safety-critical systems.

🟢 🟢 Good luck with your requirements work!
