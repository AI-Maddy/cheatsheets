⭐ ⚡ 4. Key Performance Metrics for Sensor Fusion

Metric                    | Target (L2+/L3 highway 2025–2026) | Why It Matters
-------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------
**Detection Range**       | 150–250 m (pedestrian/car)         | Early braking / decision making
**False Positive Rate**   | <1 per 1000 km                     | Driver trust & 🔴 🔴 avoid unnecessary interventions
⭐ **False Negative Rate**   | Extremely low (<0.1% critical cases)| Safety – missing a pedestrian is catastrophic
**Perception Latency**    | 50–150 ms end-to-end               | Reaction time in emergency
**Update Rate**           | 10–30 Hz                           | Smooth tracking & prediction
**Adverse Weather Robustness** | ≥80–90% of clear-weather performance | Regulatory & consumer expectation

⚙️ 5. Quick One-liners (what perception engineers say in 2025–2026)

- “Camera is still king for semantics; radar is king for velocity & weather.”
- “LiDAR is becoming a commodity – but only for high-confidence distance.”
- “BEV fusion is the 2026 standard – almost everyone moved away from separate trackers.”
- “Occupancy networks are replacing traditional object lists for free-space reasoning.”
- “Sensor fusion must provide uncertainty estimates – deterministic outputs are dead.”
- “Early fusion gives the 🟢 🟢 best results but needs 10× more compute.”
- “Redundancy is perception + monitoring channel – not just duplicate sensors.”

💻 6. Typical Sensor Suites (2025–2026 production examples)

Vehicle Class / OEM Example       | Typical Suite (2025–2026)
----------------------------------|--------------------------------
Mass-market L2 (VW, Hyundai, etc.)| 1 mono + 4 surround cameras + 5–7 radars + 12 ultrasonics
Premium L2+ (BMW, Mercedes)       | 1–3 stereo + 8–12 surround cameras + 6–9 radars + 1–3 mid-range LiDAR
L3 Highway (Mercedes Drive Pilot) | 3 LiDAR + 12 cameras + 6 radars + thermal + V2X
Tesla (Vision-only)               | 8–11 cameras + radar (reinforced 2025+) – no LiDAR
Mobileye / Tier-1 reference       | 11 cameras + 6 radars + 1–3 LiDAR (scalable)

🟢 🟢 Good luck with your ADAS perception & fusion design!  
In 2026 the winning formula is usually **camera + 4D radar fusion in BEV space** with **LiDAR as high-confidence complement** for L3 highway systems – and **occupancy networks** are rapidly becoming the standard output format for planning.
