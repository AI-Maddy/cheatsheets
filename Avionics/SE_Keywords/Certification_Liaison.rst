🤝 **Certification Liaison: Authority Engagement & Communication** (2026 Edition!)
==================================================================================

**Quick ID:** Ongoing communication with FAA/EASA throughout development (not just at end)
**Key Contact:** DER (Designated Engineering Representative) or authority POC
**Criticality Level:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ CRITICAL—Early authority engagement prevents late surprises

---

✈️ **WHAT IS CERTIFICATION LIAISON?**
====================================

**Certification Liaison** = Organized, proactive communication with authority (FAA, EASA) throughout project lifecycle to:
  ✅ **Align on approach** (authority approves PSAC, understands plan)
  ✅ **Resolve issues early** (technical questions answered before affecting project)
  ✅ **Get guidance** (authority provides direction on compliance approach)
  ✅ **Maintain confidence** (authority aware of progress, reduces surprises)
  ✅ **Prevent rework** (authority feedback incorporated early, not late)

**Core Principle:** Communicate WITH authority throughout, not AT them at certification.

📋 **CERTIFICATION LIAISON MILESTONES (SOI Meetings)**
===================================================

**SOI #1: Stage of Involvement #1 (Month 2–3)**
  🎯 **Objective:** Authority reviews PSAC (plan) and approves approach
  🎯 **Timing:** Month 2: Submit PSAC; Month 3: Authority meeting
  🎯 **Attendees:** Development team, DER, FAA/EASA
  🎯 **Discussion Topics:**
    • Overall development approach (V-model, phases, resources)
    • DAL assignment (safety criticality)
    • Tools and methodologies (MBD, formal methods?)
    • Test strategy (how will requirements be verified?)

    • Validation plan (system test, flight test planned?)
    • Objective evidence package (certification ready?)
    • Authority observations (any gaps?)
  
  🎯 **Outcome:** Authority satisfied; ready for final certification phase

**Final Certification Meeting (Month 22–24)**
  🎯 **Objective:** Authority reviews objective evidence package; issues TSO/certification
  🎯 **Attendees:** Development team, DER, FAA/EASA certification office
  🎯 **Discussion Topics:**
    • Complete objective evidence (Req ↔ Design ↔ Code ↔ Test → all linked)
    • Compliance demonstration (all DO-178C objectives met)
    • Authority findings (any gaps requiring correction?)
  
  🎯 **Outcome:** TSO/Type Certificate issued

💼 **CERTIFICATION LIAISON ACTIVITIES**
=====================================

**Activity 1: PSAC Submission & Authority Review (Month 2–3)**
  📋 Month 1: Develop PSAC draft (project team)
  📋 Month 2: Submit PSAC to authority (formal submission)
  📋 Month 3: Authority reviews; provides feedback (SOI #1 meeting)
  📋 Month 3: Incorporate feedback; finalize PSAC
  ➜ Result: PSAC approved; project can proceed

**Activity 2: Interim Updates & Technical Questions**
  📋 **As-needed communication:**
    • Technical question arises (DAL assignment for new requirement?)
    • Contact authority POC for guidance (email, phone, short meeting)
    • Authority provides direction
    • Incorporate guidance into project
  
  📋 **Regular status reports** (quarterly):
    • Email update to authority: Schedule, risks, issues, decisions
    • Authority notes any concerns
    • Communication maintains awareness

**Activity 3: SOI Milestone Meetings (Monthly 3, 10, 18)**
  📋 Each SOI includes:
    • Presentation (development team briefs authority on status)
    • Discussion (Q&A; authority provides feedback)
    • Meeting minutes (documented for objective evidence)
  
  📋 **Preparation for SOI:**
    • Develop presentation (2–3 slides per major topic)
    • Practice presentation (internal review)
    • Prepare for questions (anticipate authority concerns)
    • Create meeting agenda (share with authority 1 week ahead)

**Activity 4: Issue Resolution**
  📋 Authority may raise issues at SOI meetings:
    • "Your test strategy seems incomplete" (authority concern)
    • Team investigates (more testing needed?)
    • Team addresses issue (expands test plan)
    • Team briefs authority (issue resolved)
    • Authority satisfied; proceed

**Activity 5: Final Certification Submission (Month 22)**
  📋 Activity: Prepare objective evidence package
  📋 Submission: Send complete package to authority (6+ volumes)
  📋 Authority review: FAA/EASA technical team reviews evidence
  📋 Authority questions: Authority may request clarifications
  📋 Correction: Team provides additional evidence or explanations
  📋 Approval: Authority issues TSO/Type Certificate

⚡ **CERTIFICATION LIAISON BEST PRACTICES**
==========================================

✅ **Tip 1: Proactive early communication (don't wait for authority to ask)**
  ❌ Mistake: "Silent development; brief authority at certification"
  ✅ Right: "Regular communication; PSAC approved Month 3; SOI meetings quarterly"
  Impact: No surprises late-project; authority confidence

✅ **Tip 2: Designate DER (Designated Engineering Representative)**
  ❌ Mistake: "Authority liaison scattered across team"
  ✅ Right: "DER owns authority communication; single point of contact"
  Impact: Consistent communication; DER remembers all decisions

✅ **Tip 3: Document all authority communication (meeting minutes, decisions)**
  ❌ Mistake: "Authority guidance given verbally; not documented"
  ✅ Right: "Meeting minutes captured; authority decisions tracked"
  Impact: Objective evidence of authority guidance; no disputes later

✅ **Tip 4: Escalate issues/concerns quickly (don't hide problems)**
  ❌ Mistake: "Risk discovered Month 8; not reported until Month 18"
  ✅ Right: "Risk discovered Month 8; reported immediately to authority"
  Impact: Authority helps solve problem early; prevents late crisis

✅ **Tip 5: Authority input drives decisions (don't assume you know what FAA wants)**
  ❌ Mistake: "Develop approach we think FAA wants; surprise at certification"
  ✅ Right: "Ask FAA what they expect; incorporate feedback"
  Impact: Approach aligned with authority expectations; certification smooth

⚠️ **COMMON CERTIFICATION LIAISON MISTAKES**
==========================================

❌ **Mistake 1: No DER (no single point of contact with authority)**
  Problem: "Different people contact FAA for different questions" (confusing)
  Impact: Inconsistent messages; authority confusion
  Fix: Designate DER; all authority communication through DER

❌ **Mistake 2: PSAC submitted late (Month 8 instead of Month 2)**
  Problem: "Authority doesn't see plan until very late"
  Impact: Major issues discovered late; rework required
  Fix: Submit PSAC Month 2; SOI #1 Month 3

❌ **Mistake 3: No SOI meetings (silent development; surprise at end)**
  Problem: "Develop entire project; brief authority at certification"
  Impact: Authority has concerns; rework required; delays
  Fix: SOI meetings Month 3, 10, 18 (quarterly)

❌ **Mistake 4: Authority concerns not resolved (brushed off or deferred)**
  Problem: "Authority expresses concern; team ignores and continues"
  Impact: Same concern re-raised at certification; project delayed
  Fix: Address concerns immediately; brief authority on resolution

❌ **Mistake 5: Communication only at major milestones (no interim contact)**
  Problem: "Silent for 3 months between SOI meetings"
  Impact: Issues fester; discovered late
  Fix: Interim communication (email updates, technical questions) between SOIs
