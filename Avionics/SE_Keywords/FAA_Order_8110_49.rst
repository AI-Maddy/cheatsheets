✈️ **WHAT IS FAA ORDER 8110.49?**
=================================

**FAA Order 8110.49** = FAA's official certification procedure manual:
  ✅ **Defines** certification process (how FAA approves aircraft/engines)
  ✅ **Specifies** applicable regulations (FAA regulations for certification)
  ✅ **Describes** review procedures (how FAA reviews your design/testing)
  ✅ **Lists** acceptable compliance approaches (how you can show compliance)
  ✅ **Governs** DER role (FAA-appointed representatives and their authorities)
  ✅ **Controls** certification workflow (applications, milestone reviews, approvals)

**Authority:** FAA Order 8110.49 = Law for certification (you MUST comply)

**Scope:** Applies to ALL aircraft/engine certification projects in the US

**Relationship to DO-178C:**
  • FAA Order 8110.49: "How to get FAA certification" (big picture)
  • DO-178C: "Software standards FAA expects" (specific software requirements)
  • Together: Certification approach + software standards = complete framework

📋 **FAA ORDER 8110.49 KEY SECTIONS**
====================================

**Part 1: Certification Authority & Organization**
  🎯 Describes FAA's certification structure
  🎯 Defines types of approvers (DAR = Design Approval Representative, DER = Designated ER)
  🎯 Explains DER appointment and authorities
  🎯 Specifies FAA decision-making process

  **Key Concepts:**
    • Type Certificate (TC): FAA approval for aircraft design
    • Supplemental Type Certificate (STC): Approval for modification to existing aircraft
    • Application for Type Certificate (Form FAA 1320-1): Formal certification request

**Part 2: Certification Process & Milestones**
  🎯 Defines certification phases (planning, design, development, certification)
  🎯 Specifies review points (similar to SOI meetings in DO-178C)
  🎯 Describes authority meetings (DER/FAA authority briefings)
  🎯 Defines approval gates and sign-offs

  **Key Processes:**
    • Initial Certification Conference (ICC): Planning meeting before design
    • Preliminary Design Review (PDR): Architecture approval
    • Critical Design Review (CDR): Detailed design approval
    • Certification Readiness Review (CRR): System ready for certification
    • Type Certificate Issuance: FAA issues approval

**Part 3: Acceptable Means of Compliance**
  🎯 Specifies how projects can demonstrate compliance
  🎯 Lists acceptable standards (DO-178C, DO-254, DO-260, etc.)
  🎯 Describes alternative compliance approaches (acceptable if justified)
  🎯 Defines minimum acceptable levels of rigor

  **Key Principle:** "You can show compliance by:"
    • Following FAA-recognized standards (DO-178C)
    • Demonstrating equivalent safety (alternative approach with justification)
    • Meeting FAA-specified metrics (coverage targets, test requirements)

**Part 4: Review & Approval Authority**
  🎯 Specifies FAA's review scope (what FAA checks)
  🎯 Defines DER's review authority (what DER approves on behalf of FAA)
  🎯 Describes escalation procedures (when DER can't approve, escalates to FAA)
  🎯 Explains audit trails and documentation requirements

**Part 5: Certification Data & Objective Evidence**
  🎯 Requires submission of certification data (designs, tests, analyses)
  🎯 Specifies acceptable formats (documents, databases, reports)
  🎯 Describes data retention requirements (how long to keep documentation)
  🎯 Defines traceability and configuration management needs

⚡ **FAA ORDER 8110.49 BEST PRACTICES**
=====================================

✅ **Tip 1: Review FAA Order 8110.49 BEFORE project starts**
  ❌ Mistake: "Begin development; learn FAA Order requirements late"
  ✅ Right: "Read FAA Order 8110.49 Month 1; understand certification workflow early"
  Impact: Avoid approach conflicts; align with FAA expectations from start

✅ **Tip 2: Use FAA Order 8110.49 Part 3 to select compliance approach**
  ❌ Mistake: "Choose development approach; later FAA rejects as unacceptable"
  ✅ Right: "Review FAA Order Part 3 (acceptable means); confirm DO-178C acceptable"
  Impact: Compliance approach verified early; no rework late

✅ **Tip 3: Structure certification milestones per FAA Order 8110.49 Part 2**
  ❌ Mistake: "Plan project milestones; don't align with FAA Order requirements"
  ✅ Right: "Schedule ICC, PDR, CDR, CRR per FAA Order procedures"
  Impact: Milestones align with FAA expectations; certification smooth

✅ **Tip 4: DER authority governed by FAA Order 8110.49 Part 1 (understand limits)**
  ❌ Mistake: "Expect DER to approve something outside DER's authority"
  ✅ Right: "Understand DER's authority per FAA Order; escalate if needed"
  Impact: DER decisions valid; approvals credible

✅ **Tip 5: Certification data per FAA Order 8110.49 Part 5 (correct format/completeness)**
  ❌ Mistake: "Assemble certification data wrong format; FAA rejects"
  ✅ Right: "Review FAA Order Part 5; provide data in required format/completeness"
  Impact: Data accepted first submission; no rework

⚠️ **COMMON FAA ORDER 8110.49 MISTAKES**
======================================

❌ **Mistake 1: Project planned without reviewing FAA Order 8110.49**
  Problem: "Develop approach without knowing FAA expectations"
  Impact: Late discovery that approach unacceptable; rework required
  Fix: Review FAA Order 8110.49 Month 1 (before planning complete)

❌ **Mistake 2: Compliance approach not justified per FAA Order Part 3**
  Problem: "Use non-standard approach; FAA asks 'Why not DO-178C?'"
  Impact: Approach challenged late-project; rework required
  Fix: Justify approach per FAA Order Part 3 (equivalent safety, justified deviation)

❌ **Mistake 3: Certification milestones don't align with FAA Order procedures**
  Problem: "Schedule PDR Month 5; FAA expects Month 3 per Order procedures"
  Impact: Certification timeline extended; FAA approval delayed
  Fix: Align milestones with FAA Order Part 2 requirements

❌ **Mistake 4: DER authority exceeded (expect DER to approve outside scope)**
  Problem: "Expect DER to approve system design (DER authority limited to software)"
  Impact: DER can't approve; escalates to FAA; delays decision
  Fix: Understand DER authority per FAA Order Part 1; escalate appropriately

❌ **Mistake 5: Certification data wrong format/incomplete (per FAA Order Part 5)**
  Problem: "Submit data in project format; FAA says 'Wrong format; resubmit'"
  Impact: 2-month delay recompiling data in FAA-required format
  Fix: Review FAA Order Part 5 data requirements; provide correct format first-time
